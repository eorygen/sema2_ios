SEMA2 iOS App

Project Summary:

SEMA (Smartphone Ecological Momentary Assessment) is a suite of software for designing and conducting smartphone-based survey research. SEMA v2 involves administering a survey several times per day (at random times) over several days. However, SEMA2 can also be used to administer surveys less frequently (e.g., once daily, as in daily diary studies), or on an ad hoc basis (i.e., participants launch the survey manually at any time). Following extensive testing of the initial version of SEMA in 2013-2014, SEMA2 was developed in 2015 by researchers at Australian Catholic University and Orygen-The National Centre of Excellence in Youth Mental Health, in collaboration with a private software developer, Boosted Human. SEMA2 includes a multitude of features that enable researchers to easily and intuitively create and administer smartphone surveys and easily access and analyse collected data.
